# Preference Allocation

***

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/avisionh/Preference-Allocation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/avisionh/Preference-Allocation)

The problem we will tackle in this repository is of *preference allocation*/*one-sided matching*.

In particular, consider that we have to assign *x* people to *y* sessions. For each of these *y* sessions,
and individual person will have a preference ordering, meaning that they strictly prefer some sessions over others.

The task is to allocate these *x* people to their *y* sessions, accounting for their preferences
in such a way that the total utility of all *x* people is maximised.
