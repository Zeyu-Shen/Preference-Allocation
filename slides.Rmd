## Preference Allocation | One-sided matching of delegates to sessions

> - We have a *n* delegates who have preferences over *m* sessions they wish to go to. 

> - Delegates can only go to one session at any one time. 

> - Each session can only hold varying numbers of people.

# Or more formally...

## Defining the Problem

> - Each delegate, $d_i for i = 1, ..., n$, receives utility $u_{d_i}(s_j)$ from being matched to session $s_j$
